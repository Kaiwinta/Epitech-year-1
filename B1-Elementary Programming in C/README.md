### Setting Up

The "Setting Up" project is the first optimization project where the goal is to find the largest empty space in a file. This project typically involves analyzing the contents of a file and implementing algorithms to efficiently identify and locate the largest contiguous empty space.

### Organized

The "Organized" project focuses on implementing sorting algorithms on linked lists. Students are tasked with developing efficient algorithms to sort data stored in linked list structures. This project may include trying various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, or quick sort.

### Secured

The "Secured" project is designed to teach students about hash tables and their applications in security. In this project, students typically work in groups of two to implement a hash table data structure and use it to perform tasks related to security.
