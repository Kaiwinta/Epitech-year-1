### My_ls

The "My_ls" project is a recreation of the `ls` command in Unix-like operating systems. It involves implementing functionality to list directory contents, including file names, permissions, sizes, and timestamps. The goal is to replicate the basic functionality of the `ls` command using C programming.

### My_sokoban

The "My_sokoban" project is a Sokoban game implemented using the ncurses library for terminal-based graphics. Sokoban is a puzzle game where the player pushes boxes around a maze to specific locations. The objective of this project is to implement the game logic using C and ncurses.

### Navy

The "Navy" project involves creating a battleship-like game that can be played between two terminals using signals for communication. Players take turns firing missiles at each other's grids to sink the opponent's ships. The game utilizes signal handling and inter-process communication techniques to facilitate gameplay between two terminals.
