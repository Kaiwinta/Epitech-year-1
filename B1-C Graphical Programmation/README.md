### My_hunter

The "My_hunter" project is a Duck Hunt-like game implemented using the CSFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphical rendering. In this game, players aim and shoot at moving sprites to score points. The objective of the project is to implement the game logic, user interface, and graphics rendering using CSFML in the C programming language. To access the README for this project, navigate to the directory `My_hunter` and open the [README](My_hunter/README.md) file.

### My_radar

The "My_radar" project involves creating a radar simulation using CSFML. The goal of this project is to handle collisions between thousands of aircraft flying in a simulated airspace. The project requires implementing efficient collision detection algorithms and graphical rendering techniques using CSFML to visualize the radar simulation. To access the README for this project, navigate to the directory `My_radar` and open the [README](My_radar/README.md) file.
