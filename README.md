## First Semester

### Cpool

The C pool is the first project of the first Semester. It's 3 weeks of pure work divided into 2 parts.

#### Part1

This is the part where you start learning C and Unix. Every day you have new exercises to solve. To access the README for this part, navigate to the directory `C-Pool/Part 1` and open the [README](C-Pool/Part%201/README.md) file.

#### Part2

The second part of the C pool focuses on advanced topics such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and file handling. To access the README for this part, navigate to the directory `C-Pool/Part 2` and open the [README](C-Pool/Part%202/README.md) file.

### B1-Elementary Programming in C

In this module, students learn the fundamentals of programming in the C language. Topics include basic syntax, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and memory management. To access the README for this module, navigate to the directory `B1-Elementary Programming in C` and open the [README](B1-Elementary%20Programming%20in%20C/README.md) file.

### B1-Unix System Programming

This module covers Unix system programming concepts and techniques. Students learn about Unix/Linux operating system APIs, file I/O, processes, threads, inter-process communication (IPC), and shell scripting. To access the README for this module, navigate to the directory `B1-Unix System Programming` and open the [README](B1-Unix%20System%20Programming/README.md) file.

### B1-C Graphical Programming

This module focuses on graphical programming in the C language. It covers topics such as creating graphical user interfaces (GUI), handling events, and rendering graphics. To access the README for this module, navigate to the directory `B1-C Graphical Programming` and open the [README](B1-C%20Graphical%20Programming/README.md) file.

### B1-Math

The B1-Math module focuses on mathematical concepts relevant to computer science and software engineering. Topics covered may include algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra. To access the README for this module, navigate to the directory `B1-Math` and open the [README](B1-Math/README.md) file.

## Second Semester

I'll add everything At the end of the Semester :)
