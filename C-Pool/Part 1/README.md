### Days

The C Pool Part 1 typically consists of several days, each focusing on specific topics or exercises to help students learn the basics of programming in C and the basics in unix functions. Each day may cover different concepts such as variables, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and more.

### Project

During the C Pool Part 1, students usually work on a small project to apply the concepts they've learned or learn new skills. This project may involve tasks such as implementing basic algorithms, handling input and output, and practicing problem-solving skills.

### Rush

The "Rush" is a timed coding challenge that students often face during the C Pool Part 1. It usually involves working in a team to solve a larger problem within 2 days. The Rush is designed to test students' ability to collaborate, manage time effectively, and write code under pressure.
